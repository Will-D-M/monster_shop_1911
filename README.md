# Monster Shop
BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project

## Background and Description

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will automatically set the order status to "shipped". Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

Students will be put into 3 or 4 person groups to complete the project.\n

## Learning Goals

### Rails
* Create routes for namespaced routes
* Implement partials to break a page into reusable components
* Use Sessions to store information about a user and implement login/logout functionality
* Use filters (e.g. `before_action`) in a Rails controller
* Limit functionality to authorized users
* Use BCrypt to hash user passwords before storing in the database

### ActiveRecord
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, calculate statistics and build collections of data grouped by one or more attributes

### Databases
* Design and diagram a Database Schema
* Write raw SQL queries (as a debugging tool for AR)

## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.1.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- must use 'bcrypt' for authentication
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool like github projects
- must include a thorough README to describe their project

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project, please get permission from your instructors first

## User Roles

1. Visitor - this type of user is anonymously browsing our site and is not logged in
2. Regular User - this user is registered and logged in to the application while performing their work; can place items in a cart and create an order
3. Merchant Employee - this user works for a merchant. They can fulfill orders on behalf of their merchant. They also have the same permissions as a regular user (adding items to a cart and checking out)
4. Admin User - a registered user who has "superuser" access to all areas of the application; user is logged in to perform their work

## Order Status

1. 'pending' means a user has placed items in a cart and "checked out" to create an order, merchants may or may not have fulfilled any items yet
2. 'packaged' means all merchants have fulfilled their items for the order, and has been packaged and ready to ship
3. 'shipped' means an admin has 'shipped' a package and can no longer be cancelled by a user
4. 'cancelled' - only 'pending' and 'packaged' orders can be cancelled

## Timeframe
The following is an anticipated timeline of how these stories should be completed in order to be finished by 2/27/20 at 8pm.

* Tuesday: Story 1 && Story 10 - Story 12
* Wednesday: Story 2 - Story 9, Story 13 - Story 16
* Thursday: Story 17 - Story 22
* Friday: Story 23 - Story 26
* Saturday: Story 27 - Story 31
* Sunday: Story 32 - Story 37
* Monday: Story 38 - Story 41
* Tuesday: Story 42 - Story 48
* Wednesday: Story 49 - Story 51
* Thursday: Story 52 - 54


## Not Everything can be FULLY Deleted

In the user stories, we talk about "CRUD" functionality. However, it's rare in a real production system to ever truly delete content, and instead we typically just 'enable' or 'disable' content. Users, items and orders can be 'enabled' or 'disabled' which blocks functionality (users whose accounts are disabled should not be allowed to log in, items which are disabled cannot be ordered, orders which are disabled cannot be processed, and so on).

Disabled content should also be restricted from showing up in the statistics pages. For example: if an item is disabled, it should not appear in a list of "popular items".

Be careful to watch out for which stories allow full deletion of content, and restrictions on when they apply.

## Deploying to Heroku

```
[ ] done

User Story 1, Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor or user of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.
```

---

## Navigation
This series of stories will set up a navigation bar at the top of the screen and present links and information to users of your site.

There is no requirement that the nav bar be "locked" to the top of the screen.

### Completion of these stories will encompass the following ideas:

- the navigation is built into app/views/layouts/application.html.erb or loaded into that file as a partial
- you write a single set of tests that simply click on a link and expect that your current path is what you expect to see
- your nav tests don't need to check any content on the pages, just that current_path is what you expect

You will need to set up some basic routing and empty controller actions and empty action view files.

```

---

## User Profile Page
When a user who is not a merchant nor an admin logs into the system, they are taken to a profile page under a route of "/profile".

### Admins can act on behalf of users
Admin users can access a namespaced route of "/admin/users" to see an index page  of all non-merchant/non-admin users, and from there see each user. This will allow the admin to perform every action on a user's account that the user themselves can perform. This functionality is taken care of in User Stories 53 & 54.

## Shopping Cart and Checkout
This is what this app is all about: how a user can put things in a shopping cart and check out, creating an order in the process. We want to add functionality to the cart to increment and decrement the quantity within the cart.

### Visitors, Regular Users, and Merchant Employees only
Merchant Employees can order items in addition to regular users. Admin can not order items. This should already be taken care of through the navigation restrictions you set in User Stories 5 & 9.

That order is associated with my user
I am taken to my orders page ("/profile/orders")
I see a flash message telling me my order was created
I see my new order listed on my profile orders page
My cart is now empty
```

---

## User Order Show Page
The show page template for an order can be shared between users, merchants and admins to DRY up our presentation logic. They will operate through separate controllers, though.

### User Control
- Users can cancel an order if an admin has not "shipped" that order
- When an order is cancelled, any fulfilled items have their inventory returned to their respective merchants

### Merchant Control
- Merchants only see items in the order that are sold by that merchant
- Items from other merchants are hidden

### Admin Control
- Admins can cancel an order on behalf of a user
- Admins can ship orders
- Admins can fulfill items on order on behalf of a merchant

```

---

## Merchant Dashboard
This is the landing page when a merchant logs in. Here, they will see their contact information (but cannot change it), some statistics, and a list of pending orders that require the merchant's attention.

### Admins can act on behalf of merchants
Admin users will see more information on the "/admin/merchants" route that all users see. For example, on this page, an admin user can navigate to each merchant's dashboard under a route like "/admin/merchants/7". This will allow the admin to perform every action that the merchant themselves can perform. Fulfilling merchant items will be an extension in User Stories 61 & 62

---

## Merchant Items
Merchants need CRUD functionality for items in the database. These stories will work through the management of items. These routes should be namespaced like "/merchant/items" and "/merchant/items/6" and so on. Merchants can disable items so they are no longer for sale but stay in the database so orders are still handled properly. Merchants can fully delete items if nobody has ever ordered it.

### Admin functionality
Admin users share all management functionality, but the routes will be much longer, like "/admin/merchants/8/items" and "/admin/merchants/8/items/6" and so on.

## Merchant Order Fulfillment
Merchants must "fulfill" each ordered item for users. They will visit an order show page which will allow them to mark each item as fulfilled. Once every merchant marks their items for an order as "fulfilled" then the whole order switches its status to "packaged" (User Story 31). Merchants cannot fulfill items in an order if they do not have enough inventory in stock. If a user cancels an order after a merchant has fulfilled an item, the quantity of that item is returned to the merchant.

### Admin functionality
Admin can ship orders (taken care of in user story 33). Admin can fulfill items in an order on behalf of a merchant (this is an extension).

If your team finished all other user stories, it is expected that you will begin work on the following additional stories.

The index page indicated in these stories should be namespaced under a route "/admin". This route should only be accessible to admin users of your application. Any functionality mentioned in this epic should be performed by admin users only, and respective routes should all be namespaced under "/admin"

User Story 58, EXTENSION: Admin can edit a user's profile data

As an admin user
When I visit a user's profile page ("/admin/users/5")
And I click the link to edit the user's profile data
The same behaviors exist as if I were that user trying to change their own data
Except I am returned to the show page path of
"/admin/users/5" when I am finished
```

User Story 59, EXTENSION: Admin disables a user account

As an admin user
When I visit the user index page
I see a "disable" button next to any users who are not yet disabled
I see an "enable" button next to any users whose accounts are disabled.
If I click on a "disable" button for an enabled user
I am returned to the admin's user index page
And I see a flash message that the user's account is now disabled
And I see that the user's account is now disabled
This user cannot log in
This user's city/state and orders should not be part of any statistics.
```

User Story 60, EXTENSION: Admin enables a user account

As an admin user
When I visit the user index page
And I click on a "enable" button for a disabled user
I am returned to the admin's user index page
And I see a flash message that the user's account is now enabled
And I see that the user's account is now enabled
This user can now log in
This user's city/state and orders should be included in all statistics.

User Story 61, EXTENSION: Admin can manage items on behalf of a merchant

As an admin user
When I visit a merchant's profile page
I can click on the merchant's items link
And have access to all functionality the merchant does, including
- adding new items

- enabling/disabling/deleting items

All content rules still apply (eg, item name cannot be blank, etc)
```

User Story 62, EXTENSION: Admin can fulfill order items on behalf of a merchant

As an admin user
When I visit a Merchant's order show page
For each item in the order
If the user's desired quantity is less than the merchant's current inventory
I can fulfill that item
If the user's desired quantity is greater than the merchant's current inventory quantity for that item
Then I do not see a "fulfill" button or link
Instead I see a big red notice next to the item indicating I cannot fulfill this item
```



## Rubric

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** | **Documentation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class to effectively organize code and adhere to MVC. | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class. Even `.each` calls will not cause additional database lookups. | Very clear Test Driven Development. Test files are extremely well organized and nested. Students utilize `before :each` blocks. 100% coverage for features and models. Close to all edge cases are accounted for.| Final project has a well written README with pictures, schema design, code snippets, contributors names linked to their github profile, heroku link, and implementation instructions. |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement sad path and edge case functionality. | Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code. Students can defend any of their design decisions. Students limit access to authorized users. | ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data using no Ruby to process data. | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. | Students have a README with thorough implementation instructions and description of content. |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students complete all but 1 - 3 User Stories | Students utilize MVC to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. Or some functionality is not limited to the appropriately authorized users. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. | Students have a README but it is not thorough in describing the implementation or content of the project. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 4 or more User Stories | Students do not effectively organize code using MVC. Or students do not authorize users. | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. | Students did not create their own README. |
